# Mechanism-Oriented Reaction Descriptors for living radical polymerization
Mechanism-Oriented Reaction Descriptors can be used to construct quantitative structure–property relationship (QSPR) models that are both highly predictive and interpretable for predicting the polydispersity index (PDI) of living radical polymerization (LRP) in nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization(NMP). Since the descriptor follows the mechanism of LRP focusing on the equilibrium constant for forming dormant species from catalyst and propagating species, it is expected to be adapted to other living radical approaches.
